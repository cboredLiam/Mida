      <p>You awake, lying on a cold concrete floor. You get up, still fuzzy from the flash, then look around. Around you is an empty room with no obvious ways out. No door, no openings, and nothing of value.</p>
      <p>While pondering in the room, you don't remember much what happened after the flash, and you still haven't fully recovered. Your vision is poor, and you seem to be in a confused daze. </p>
