      <p>A piece of a wall slowly fades away before you. It reveals a short hall leadinG to another room, slIghtly larger than the curreNt room.</p>
      <p>You get into the second room, and observe that the room isn't any better than the previous one. It also has no openinGs, and even worse as there aren't even any obvious writing. The hallway to thE first room seemed to have disappeared while you turned your back fRom it. No going back now, not like you want to anyway.</p>
