      <p>A noise behind you startles you for a second. You look to where the sound is from.</p>
      <p>A swung open trapdoor has appeared, revealing an intimidating flight of stairs — stairs made out of concrete, odd for a cabin.</p>
      <p>You begin to climb down the stairs.</p>
      <p>...</p>                                        
      <p>The stairs end, and you reach an empty concrete room — very different from the cabin.</p>
      <p>There seems to be no way out, but considering the past few situations, an escape is bound to appear.</p>
