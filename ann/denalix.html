      <p>A wall moves beside you, shaking the entire room with its might. It slowly reveals another room, this time with an unnaturally bright light source coming from seemingly nowhere. At this point, you shouldn't really question anything.</p>
      <p>A writing is on the wall, yet again. Another puzzle to be solved.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>Actually, on the topic of questioning, shouldn't you be more distressed? Weirded out? You've adapted quite quickly already, with all these roundabout riddles. This dimension defies everything you know about the world. Nothing looks real, light comes from nowhere, the landscape is abnormal — nothing makes sense! On the topic of nothing making sense, why have you been transported in this world — this wicked, riddle-filled dimension? You recall no memories on how you came here, nothing at all!</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>You ponder.</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>...</p>  
      <p></p> 
      <p></p> 
      <p>...</p>  
      <p></p> 
      <p>Nothing. Nothing. It's just time to accept this current situation, do anything to remember any memory — and most importantly — to escape this dimension.</p>
