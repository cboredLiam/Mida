      <p>A wall moves beside you, shaking the entire room with its might. It slowly reveals another room, this time with an unnaturally bright light source coming from seemingly nowhere. At this point, you shouldn't really question anything.</p>
      <p>A writing is on the wall, yet again. Another puzzle to be solved.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>...</p>  
      <p>Actually, on the topic of questioning, shouldn't you be more distressed? Weirded out? This dimension defies everything you know about the world. Nothing looks real, light comes from nowhere, the landscape is abnormal â€” nothing makes sense!</p>
