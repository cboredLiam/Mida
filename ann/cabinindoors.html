      <p>After being in the forest for long, this cabin is a great change of scenery which also provides shelter. A great place to rest.</p>
      <p>Inspecting the cabin, it seems like it has more things inside than you expected it to have. A most noticable find is a blotch of darkness that weirdly pulsates, which scares you a bit.</p>
