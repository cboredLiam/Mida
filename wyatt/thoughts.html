      <p>Behind your back, the door opens with a loud tick as its lock opens. It leads to another room, but this time it's a properly sized room.</p>
      <p>The room is empty but a door and more writings on the wall. You try to open the door but you predict for it to be locked, and it is indeed locked. Shocking.</p>
