      <p>You close your eyes to calm your senses. You feel like you're floating in space, drifting away.</p>
      <p>After a while, you feel as if you've come in contact with something, something cold. You open your eyes and you see a ceiling. Looking around, it looks like you're in a hallway.</p>

      <p>There are two ends to the hallway, one leading to a door and one leading to a wall, so maybe it's more of a thin room than a hallway. A big message rests on the left wall when facing the door. The door is locked and presumably needs an answer.</p>
