      <p>Some time has passed after the flash. You feel yourself positioned, lying on a floor.</p>
      <p>You try to get up, but somehow — while leveraging yourself up — your hand seems to not be in contact with the floor. Are you near an edge, perhaps? Dangerously lying beside a ledge?</p>
      <p>You look around and see that everything around you is pitch black.</p> 
      <p></p>
      <p>You try to sit up instead, but while trying to sit up, your legs seem to phase through the floor as well.</p>                                        
      <p>Must you be floating? You seem to not be colliding with anything — anything in this pitch black room. Or maybe this isn't a pitch black room, is this a void with no gravity? But as you awoke, you felt like you were lying on a floor.</p>
